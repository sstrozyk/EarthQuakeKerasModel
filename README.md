Keras model for earthquake damage pediction during 2010 earthquake
# Earthquake Damage Model

## Description
This Python script is designed to predict the damage grade of buildings after an earthquake. It uses a neural network model built with TensorFlow and Keras, along with data processing with pandas and scikit-learn.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

2.Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh

python -m venv venv

    Activate the virtual environment:
        On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        On macOS and Linux: source venv/bin/activate

3.Install the required packages:

sh

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    1. Prepare your data: modify values in main to reflect the URL of the various data sets

    Run the script:

    python EarthQuakeDamageModelv1.py


The script will train a model based on the provided data and output the model's performance.
